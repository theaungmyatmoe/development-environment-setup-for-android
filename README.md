# About This Project

This is just a manual (or) guideline for developers who want to develope their application in Android Linux.
In Android Linux we can do many cool stuffs but don't forget everything will not work in it.

# What Android can do?

In Android Linux you can develope web application,system adminstration (if you have root access),hacking something (you should have root access but we can do a few thing without root access) ,etc.

# What we will use?

We will use `Termux` (a terminal emulator for Android) to run Linux/Unit commands and it will help you to install some compilers such as PHP,RustLang,C++,etc.
`Termux` will help us to develope our applications in Android Linux.
